\section{CARMA}\label{sec:3.2}

%The VLA's resolution is generally diffraction-limited, and thus is set by the array configuration and frequency of observation. It is important to be aware that a synthesis array is "blind" to structures on angular scales both smaller and larger than the range of fringe spacings given by the antenna distribution. For the former limitation, the VLA acts like any single antenna - structures smaller than the diffraction limit (θ ∼ λ/D) are not seen -- the resulting image will be smoothed to the resolution of the array. The latter limitation is unique to interferometers; it means that structures on angular scales significantly larger than the fringe spacing formed by the shortest baseline are not measured. No subsequent processing can fully recover this missing information, which can only be obtained by observing in a smaller array configuration, by using the mosaicing method, or by utilizing data from an instrument (such as a large single antenna or an array comprising smaller antennas) which provides this information.

\section{Arcturus and Aldebaran}\label{sec:3.4}

Currently the most detailed spatial information about the atmospheres of K and early M evolved stars is obtained from eclipsing binaries such as the $\zeta$ Aurigae and symbiotic systems (e.g., \citealt{wright_1970}; \citealt{baade_1996}; \citealt{eaton_2008}; \citealt{crowley_2008}). Even though these systems offer us the best opportunity to obtain information on the dynamics and thermodynamics at various heights in the evolved star's atmosphere, the very nature of the binary system may introduce further complexities. For example, the orbital separation is often within the wind acceleration region and one could expect flow perturbations to be present (e.g., \citealt{chapman_1981}). In fact, using the old VLA, \cite{harper_2005} were able to confirm that the velocity structure of  of $\zeta$ Aurigae is not typical of single stars with similar spectral types, such as $\lambda$ Velorum \citep{carpenter_1999}. In order to avoid the assumed additional complexities of a companion, we have selected two single luminosity class III red giants: Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo: K2 III) and Aldebaren ($\alpha$ Tau: K5 III). These nearby red giants have been extensively studied at other wavelengths and their stellar parameters, which are summarized in Table x, are accurately known. These stars are predicted to be point sources at all frequencies between 1 and 50 GHz in all VLA configurations so our radio observations measure their total flux density, $F_{\nu}$ (e.g. Our observations which are detailed in Section x, were taken in B configuration which has a maximum angular resolution of $\sim 0.14 \arcsec$ at Q band which is $\approx 7\ R_{\star}$ for both stars.). Moreover, both stars have existing semi-empirical 1-D chromospheric and wind models which we directly compare to our data.

\textbf{\textit{Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo: K2 III)}}\\
Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo: K2 III) is the nearest ($d=11.3$ pc) and brightest ($V=-0.04$ mag) noncoronal red giant and is probably the best example of a red giant that can be studied in detail with the VLA. It is the leader of a group of stars that share a similar V  space velocity (the component of stellar motion relative to the LSR in the direction of rotation),  age ($\geq10$ Gyr), and metallicity ([Fe/H] $\sim -0.5$), known as the Arcturus moving group \citep{eggen_1971}. The group has traditionally been regarded as the remains of a dissolved open cluster \citep[e.g.,][]{eggen_1971,eggen_1996} but it has also been suggested to be  the debris of a metal-poor accreted satellite some billions of years ago \citep{navarro_2004}. Recent analysis of chemical abundances are consistent with the former hypothesis but do not entirely rule out a merger one \citep{williams_2009}.

\textit{Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau: K5 III)}\\
Both of these late-type giants have \textit{hybrid atmospheres} as they show evidence for both coronal/transition region activity and strong winds. Even though they are slow rotators, a magnetic field (albeit weak) has been detected on $\alpha$ Boo \citep{sennhauser_2011} along with a magnetic cycle with a period of $\geq 14$ years \citep{brown_2008}. 

Also, the detection of O $\textsc{vi}$ in $\alpha$ Tau \citep{dupree_2005} suggests magnetic activity in its atmosphere.
\section{The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array}\label{sec:3.5}
The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) is an aperture synthesis radio telescope located on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico, USA and is capable of producing radio images with a resolution comparable to that of optical telescopes. It is the product of a program to modernize the electronics of the old VLA which had been in operation since the late 1970's. One of the main upgrades to the VLA is the addition of the Wideband Interferometric Digital Architecture (WIDAR) correlator which allows the digital correlation of very wideband signals. WIDAR digitally filters and splits the data into sub-bands which are then separately cross-correlated and integrated before being stitched together again to yield the final wideband spectrum. The new WIDAR correlator and its superior bandwidth capability provides the VLA with greater sensitivity, allowing the detection of lower flux density sources than was previously possible with the old VLA. A comparison of the performance parameters of the VLA with those of the old VLA is shown in Table \ref{tab:3.1}. The three major new observational abilities of the VLA are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete frequency coverage between 1 and 50 GHz.
\item An increase in continuum sensitivity by an order of magnitude at some frequencies, by increasing the bandwidth to 8 GHz per polarization.
\item Process the large bandwidth with a minimum of 16,384 spectral channels per baseline.
\end{enumerate}

Apart from the addition of more feeds at the center of the reflector, the structural design of the VLA has not changed during its recent upgrade. As before it consists of 27 fully steerable alt-azimuth antennas arranged along the arms of an upside-down `Y' as shown in Figure \ref{fig2.9}.  The array is reconfigurable and can vary its resolution by over a factor of $\sim 50$ through movement of its component antennas along twin railroad tracks. Four standard configurations of antennas along the arms of the array are possible whose scales vary by the ratios 1 : 3.28 : 10.8 : 35.5 from smallest to largest. These are called D, C, B, and A configurations, with A having the longest baselines ($\sim 36$ km) giving the best angular resolution, but lacking short baselines needed for imaging extended structure. In each configuration, the distance of each antenna from the center of the `Y' is equal to $m^{\rm{ln}2}$ where $m$ is the antenna location number, counting outwards from the center of each arm. With this design, the $m$'th station in any configuration coincides with the 2$m$'th station in the next smaller configuration. This means that only 72 stations are needed to handle all four configurations. Additionally, there are 3 \textit{hybrid} configurations called DnC, CnB, and BnA, which are well suited for sources with low declinations. In these configurations, the North arm antennas are deployed in the next larger configuration than the SE and SW arm antennas resulting in a more circular synthesized beam for these sources.

Each antenna is 25 m in diameter giving the array a total collecting area equivalent to a single dish of 130 m in diameter. Each antenna has an off-axis Cassegrain design with a rotatable sub-reflector at the prime focus of the main reflector and is supported by four feed legs. All feeds are located on a feed ring at the Cassegrain focus and the observing feed is changed by rotating the asymmetric sub-reflector about the main reflector axis so that the secondary focal point moves to the desired feed. The standard observing mode for all feeds is circular polarization. RF signals from each feed  are sent via a waveguide to the antenna vortex room located directly underneath the main reflector where they are feed into low noise front ends. The vortex room is temperature controlled and also contains cryogenic cooling systems for the front end, portions of the LO, and IF equipment. IF signals from each antenna are sent by cable to a shielded room where the sampler and delay and multiplier racks are located. \textbf{Once the signals have been cross-correlated they are time averaged into visibility measurements.}

All VLA antennas are outfitted with eight receivers providing continuous frequency coverage between 1 and 50 GHz. As shown in Table x, the frequency ranges of 1-2 GHz, 2-4 GHz, 4-8 GHz, 8-12 GHz, 12-18 GHz, 18-26.5 GHz, 26.5-40 GHz, and 40-50 GHz, are commonly referred to as L, S, C, X, Ku, K, Ka, and Q bands, respectively. Additionally, the VLA is currently being outfitted with even lower frequency receivers, P-band (230-470 MHz) and 4-band (54-86 MHz). The VLA's angular resolution is set by the maximum baseline $B_{\rm{max}}$ and frequency of observation. This means that structures smaller than the diffraction limit ($\theta_{\rm{HPBW}}^{\rm{SB}} \sim \lambda/B_{\rm{max}}$) will be smoothed to the resolution of the array. Table x summarizes the maximum resolution for each of the four main configurations at each wavelength. The resolution is defined here as the HPBW of the synthesized beam, using uniform weighting, over a full 12 hour synthesis observation of a source which passes near the zenith. For completeness, we also give the field of view (FOV) at each observing frequency in Table x, defined as the HPBW  of the primary beam, which for the VLA antennas can be approximated using the formula: $\theta_{\rm{HPBW}} ^{\rm{PB}} (')= 45/\nu _{\rm{GHz}}$. 

\section{VLA Observations of Arcturus and Aldebaran}\label{sec:3.6}

The Open Shared Risk Observing (OSRO) program at the VLA existed during its commissioning phase to provide observers with early access to a number of VLA correlator capabilities and observing modes. This represented a considerable improvement over the capabilities of the old VLA correlator as observes were provided with increased bandwidth capability at existing VLA bands, increased spectral resolution capabilities, and access to new spectral bands. In September 2010 our proposal (PI: G. M. Harper, Program ID: 10C-105) to observe two archetypical red giants at multiple frequencies was allocated the requested 15.5 hours of observing time with the VLA as part of NRAO's OSRO Science Program 2010C. A number of observing scripts called scheduling blocks (SBs) were prepared during December 2010 and their duration were kept to $\leq 2.5$ hours to increase their likelihood of been scheduled. The VLA now uses dynamic scheduling for deciding which SBs are executed at any time. It takes into account many factors like the scheduling priority assigned by the time allocation committee, weather constraints, and SB duration. Dynamic scheduling means that the observer does not know when their observations will occur but in general, the chances of observations being scheduled are increased if the duration of the SB is kept short.

Our main set of observations took place in February 2011 while the VLA was in B-configuration. All observations were taken in continuum mode and the correlator was set up with two 128 MHz sub-bands centered on the frequencies listed in Table x. Each sub-band had sixty-four channels of width 2 MHz and four polarization products (RR, LL, RL, LR). We obtained all our requested observations of $\alpha$ Tau in just two days between the 11$^{\rm{th}}$ and 13$^{\rm{th}}$ of February 2011 which consisted of Q, Ka, K, X, C, and S band observations of the star. We did not request L band (i.e. 1.5 GHz) observations of $\alpha$ Tau as it was believed that the star would be too faint to be observable at this frequency. There was also insufficient Ku band receivers available at the time to carry out observations at 15 GHz. We obtained Q, Ka, K, X, C, and S band observations of $\alpha$ Boo in eleven days between the 11$^{\rm{th}}$ and 22$^{\rm{nd}}$ of February 2011. We also had prepared a 2.5 hour SB for $\alpha$ Boo at L-band but this SB was never executed. 

For this reason we applied for (and were awarded) 3 additional hours of directors discretionary time (DDT) in early 2012 (PI: E. O'Gorman, Program ID: 12A-472) to observe $\alpha$ Boo at S and L band. We decided to include a short observation at S band even though we already had an observation at this band to make sure that the stars flux density had not significantly changed over that period and so any possible L band detection could be included in the analysis of the main set of data from the previous year. Our DDT observations took place in July 2012 when the VLA was again in B-configuration and some of these details are given in Table x. The capabilities of the VLA had greatly increased in the $\sim 1.5$ years since the main set of observations and we now could utilize the full 1 and 2 GHz of bandwidth at L and S band, respectively. The 1-2 GHz and 2-4 GHz frequency ranges were both divided into 16 sub-bands, each with sixty-four channels. The channel width was 2 and 1 MHz for S and L-band, respectively, and each sub-band had four polarization products (RR, LL, RL, LR).

In radio interferometry, baseline-dependent additive errors in the visibilities can occasionally lead to artifacts occurring at phase center of the final image. Such errors may be caused by unflagged low level interference picked up by some antennas baselines. An example of this is demonstrated in Figure x in which two radio images of Betelgeuse at 15 GHz are shown (A. Brown, priv. comm.). The left panel was taken on 2$^{\rm{nd}}$ February \textbf{2002} and shows a 30$\sigma$ detection of Betelgeuse with low level background noise. The right panel which was taken two months later on 2$^{\rm{nd}}$ April \textbf{2002} again shows a strong 45$\sigma$ detection of the star but also now shows a 15$\sigma$ artifact at phase center. If the target had been observed at phase center in this case, then this artifact would lead to an incorrect flux density measurement for the star. For our VLA observations, both $\alpha$ Boo and $\alpha$ Tau were slightly offset from the phase-center by $\sim 5$ synthesized beam widths in order to avoid source contamination by any phase center artifacts and to avoid spurious detections.

The main problem at low VLA frequencies (L and S bands) is disturbances in the ionosphere caused by solar activity. At L-band, solar flares can be as strong as $1 \times 10^6$ Jy and are a major source of interference, with their effects sometimes being impossible to remove from the data. To avoid such problems the S and L band SBs were scheduled for night time observing only. The low to intermediate frequency observations (L - X bands) were composed of repeatedly interleaved observations of the target and a nearby phase calibrator with cycle times of 12 minutes; 10 minutes on the target and 2 minutes on the phase calibrator. For $\alpha$ Boo, the point source J1415+1320 which is located 6$^{\circ}$ away was used as the phase calibrator at these frequencies. For $\alpha$ Tau, the point source J0449+1121 located 6$^{\circ}$ away was used at C and X band, while the brighter J0431+2037 located 4$^{\circ}$ away was used at S band due to it being unresolved at this frequency (but is resolved at C and X band). The primary calibration sources 3C286 and 3C138 were observed at the end of all low and intermediate frequency SBs and were used to measure the bandpass and set the absolute flux for $\alpha$ Boo and $\alpha$ Tau, respectively. The top panel in Figure x shows a plot of elevation against time for all the sources observed in the SB of the C and X band observations of $\alpha$ Tau. In this SB, observations of $\alpha$ Tau at X band were interspersed between C band observations throughout the track to obtain a good spread in $u-v$ coverage. 
%The additional time spent on the phase calibrator at the start of the SB is a requirement to make sure you get on source. 

At high VLA frequencies (i.e. K, Ka, and Q band) the troposphere can cause major phase variations to incoming radio waves. To reduce this problem, the old VLA used a technique called \textit{fast switching} which reduced the setup overhead and slewing compared to traditional iterating between source and calibrator scans. This overhead is sufficiently reduced with the new VLA and no special fast switching mode is necessary. Instead regular but short duration source-calibrator loops are implemented. As a result, the calibration overheads for high frequency observing are typically considerably larger than for lower frequency observations. For both stars, the total cycle times for the Q, Ka, and K-band observations were 160, 230, and 290 s, respectively. These high frequency observations were combined into a single 2 hour SB for each star and commenced with X-band reference pointing with solutions being applied on-line. As mentioned in Section x, the blind pointing errors of the VLA antennas can occasionally be as large as the HPBW of the primary beam at high frequencies. Thankfully, the pointing can be calibrated for using a technique known as \textit{reference pointing} whereby a nearby known calibrator is observed in interferometer pointing mode every hour or so. The measured local pointing corrections are then be applied to subsequent target observations. Reference pointing can reduce the rms pointing errors to as little as 2$\arcsec$ if the reference source is with 10$^\circ$ of the target source. After X-band pointing the target source was observed at Q-band to ensure the best pointing solutions were used as shown in the lower panel of Figure x for $\alpha$ Tau.
