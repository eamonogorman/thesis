\section{CARMA}\label{sec:3.2}

%The VLA's resolution is generally diffraction-limited, and thus is set by the array configuration and frequency of observation. It is important to be aware that a synthesis array is "blind" to structures on angular scales both smaller and larger than the range of fringe spacings given by the antenna distribution. For the former limitation, the VLA acts like any single antenna - structures smaller than the diffraction limit (θ ∼ λ/D) are not seen -- the resulting image will be smoothed to the resolution of the array. The latter limitation is unique to interferometers; it means that structures on angular scales significantly larger than the fringe spacing formed by the shortest baseline are not measured. No subsequent processing can fully recover this missing information, which can only be obtained by observing in a smaller array configuration, by using the mosaicing method, or by utilizing data from an instrument (such as a large single antenna or an array comprising smaller antennas) which provides this information.

\section{The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array}\label{sec:3.5}
The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) is an aperture synthesis radio telescope located on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico, USA and is capable of producing radio images with a resolution comparable to that of optical telescopes. It is the product of a program to modernize the electronics of the `old' VLA which had been in operation since the late 1970's. One of the main upgrades to the VLA is the addition of the Wideband Interferometric Digital Architecture (WIDAR) correlator which allows the digital correlation of very wideband signals. WIDAR digitally filters and decimates data into lower rate sub-bands which are then separately cross-correlated and integrated before being stitched together again to yield the final wideband spectrum. The new WIDAR correlator and its much greater bandwidths provide the synthesis array with greater sensitivities, allowing the detection of lower flux density sources than was possible with the `old' VLA. A comparison of the performance parameters of the VLA with those of the `old' VLA is shown in Table \ref{tab:3.1}. The three major new observational abilities of the VLA are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete frequency coverage between 1 and 50 GHz.
\item An increase in continuum sensitivity by an order of magnitude at some frequencies, by increasing the bandwidth to 8 GHz per polarization.
\item Process the large bandwidth with a minimum of 16,384 spectral channels per baseline.
\end{enumerate}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:3.1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The structural design of the VLA has not changed during its recent upgrade. As before it consists of 27 fully steerable alt-azimuth antennas arranged along the arms of an upside-down `Y'.  The array is reconfigurable and can vary its resolution by over a factor of $\sim 50$ through movement of its component antennas along twin railroad tracks. Four standard configurations of antennas along the arms of the array are possible whose scales vary by the ratios 1 : 3.28 : 10.8 : 35.5 from smallest to largest. These are called D, C, B, and A configurations, with A having the longest baselines ($\sim 36$ km) giving the best angular resolution, but lacking short baselines needed for imaging extended structure. In each configuration, the distance of each antenna from the center of the `Y' is equal to $m^{\rm{ln}2}$ where $m$ is the antenna location number, counting outwards from the center of each arm. With this design, the $m$'th station in any configuration coincides with the 2$m$'th station in the next smaller configuration. This means that only 72 stations are needed to handle all four configurations. Additionally, there are 3 `hybrid' configurations called DnC, CnB, and BnA, which are well suited for sources with low declinations. In these configurations, the North arm antennas are deployed in the next larger configuration than the SE and SW arm antennas resulting in a more circular dirty beam for these sources.

Each antenna is 25 m in diameter giving the array a total collecting area equivalent to a single dish of 130 m in diameter. Each antenna has an off-axis Cassegrain design with a rotatable sub-reflector at the prime focus of the main reflector supported by four feed legs. All feeds are located on a feed ring at the Cassegrain focus and the observing feed is changed by rotating the asymmetric sub-reflector about the main reflector axis so that the secondary focal point moves to the desired feed. The standard observing mode for all feeds is circular polarization. Radio frequency (RF) signals from each feed  are sent via waveguide to the antenna vortex room located directly underneath the main reflector where they are feed into low noise front ends. The vortex room is temperature controlled and also contains cryogenic cooling systems for the front end, portions of the local oscillator (LO), and intermediate frequency (IF) equipment. IF signals from each antenna are sent by cable to a shielded room where the sampler and delay and multiplier racks are located. Once the signals have been cross-correlated they are time averaged into visibility measurements.

All VLA antennas are outfitted with eight receivers providing continuous frequency coverage between 1 and 50 GHz. As shown in Table x, the frequency ranges of 1-2 GHz, 2-4 GHz, 4-8 GHz, 8-12 GHz, 12-18 GHz, 18-26.5 GHz, 26.5-40 GHz, and 40-50 GHz are commonly referred to as L, S, C, X, Ku, K, Ka, and Q bands, respectively. Additionally, the VLA is currently being outfitted with even lower frequency receivers, P-band (230-470 MHz) and 4-band (54-86 MHz). The VLA's resolution is set by the maximum baseline $B_{\rm{max}}$ and frequency of observation. This means that structures smaller than the diffraction limit ($\theta_{\rm{HPBW}} \sim \lambda/B_{\rm{max}}$) will be smoothed to the resolution of the array. Table x summarizes the resolution (defined here as as the HPBW of the synthesized beamwidth, using uniform weighting, over a full 12 hour synthesis observation of a source which passes near the zenith) achievable for each of the four main configurations at each wavelength. For completeness, we also give the field of view (FOV) at each observing frequency, defined as the HPBW  of the primary beam, which for the VLA antennas can be approximated using the formula: $\theta _{\rm{PB}} (')= 45/\nu _{\rm{GHz}}$.
