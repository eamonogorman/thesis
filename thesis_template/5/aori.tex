\chapter{Multi-wavelength Study of Betelgeuse's Outer Atmosphere} \label{chap:5}

In this chapter we present the results from our multi-wavelength high resolution study of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The majority of this chapter is based on the findings of \cite{ogorman_2012} and detail the results of our sub-arcsecond resolution study into the distribution and kinematics of CO\footnote{Throughout this chapter the usage of the term CO refers to the molecular isotope $^{12}$C$^{16}$O.} around Betelgeuse using the CO($J=2-1$) rotational line as the main probe. The variation of the emission line profile with different CARMA array configurations provides us with a unique insight into the distribution and kinematics of the two previously known flows, S1 and S2, around Betelgeuse. We successfully image the star on spatial scales as small as $0\arcsec .9$ ($\sim 20\,R_{\star}$) over a $32\arcsec$ ($\sim 750\,R_{\star}$) field of view and we discuss these radio maps in detail. We compare these results to higher CO rotational lines obtained with other instruments. We also present the recent findings of \cite{richards_2013} who image two distinct chromospheric features at centimeter wavelengths. These surprising findings motivated us to re-analyze old VLA-Pie Town data to search for these features at shorter wavelengths with comparable resolution, the results of which are presented at the end of this chapter. 

\section{CO molecules in the CSE of Betelgeuse}
\label{sec:5.1}
The CSE of Betelgeuse ($\alpha$ Ori) is a proving ground for ideas and theories of mass loss from oxygen-rich M-type supergiants. Currently it is losing mass at a respectable rate $\sim 2\times 10^{-6} \ M_{\odot}$ yr${}^{-1}$ \citep{harper_2001}, as it has been over the past $\sim$ 1000 years. Most of the optically thin silicate dust lies beyond $\sim 46$ stellar radii \citep{danchi_1994} and dust is, therefore, unlikely to be responsible for the bulk mass loss. This raises the important point that if the mass loss from Betelgeuse is not a result of dust then perhaps the same mechanisms that are responsible might also be active in the more dusty later M-type supergiants. Radiation pressure on atoms and molecules is another potential contributing candidate as a mass loss mechanism and so spatial and dynamical studies of molecules are a fruitful line of investigation, especially in relation to eventual formation of dust. Such studies also allow us to calculate the time scales on which certain mass loss episodes have occurred, and these can then be compared to the time scales of potential mass-loss initiators such as convection or magnetic dynamo cycles.

Despite the initial reports of an enhancement of C abundance in its atmosphere \citep{spinrad_1966}, Betelgeuse is now known to be an oxygen-rich star. The comprehensive study of CO and OH ro-vibrational bands by \cite{lambert_1984} found log\,$\epsilon$(C) $ = 8.4$ and log\,$\epsilon$(O)$ = 8.8$. For any species X
\begin{equation}
\rm{log}\,\epsilon(X)=\rm{log}\,(X/H)+12,
\end{equation}
which can be used to show O/C$ = 2.5$. \cite{lambert_1984} also found log\,$\epsilon$(N)$ = 8.6$ which indicates a contamination of the atmosphere with C-N processed material. This is in agreement with the theoretical work of \cite{lamb_1976} who predict the dredging up of processed material by the deep convective envelope which a supergiant like Betelgeuse is expected to possess. Betelgeuse is unlikely to have undergone a second dredge-up of material that would cause small changes in the CNO abundances due to its mass being greater than the upper mass limit for a second dredge-up to occur.  This second dredge-up is predicted to occur after He core exhaustion for stars below $8-10 \,M_{\odot}$ \citep{kaler_1978}. The observed $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio, which is an indication of the history of nuclear processing and mixing in the interior of stars \citep{pavlenko_2003,eggleton_2007} has consistently found to be between 6 and 7 \citep{lambert_1974,hinkle_1976,bernat_1979,harris_1984}, well below the predicted value of 20 \citep{charbonnel_1995,pavlenko_2003}, which is the case for most red giant stars \citep[e.g.,][]{boothroyd_1999}.

\end{figure}

The study of CO molecules in the CSE of Betelgeuse began with the detection of 4.6\,$\mu$m ro-vibrational absorption lines of $\rm{{}^{12}C^{16}O}$ and $\rm{{}^{13}C^{16}O}$ by \cite{bernat_1979} who identified two absorption features shown in Figure \ref{fig:5.1}, implying two distinct components within the overall outflow. One component, known as S1, has a Doppler shift of $9\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ towards us with T$_{\rm{exc}}\,\simeq\,200\,\rm{K}$, $v_{\rm{turb}}\,\simeq\,4$\,km\,s${}^{-1}$, and N$_{\rm{CO}}=4.7\times 10^{17}\>{\rm cm}^{-2}$. The second faster component, known as S2, has a Doppler shift of $16\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ towards us with T$_{\rm{exc}} \simeq$ 70 $\rm{K}$, $v_{\rm{turb}}\simeq 1$\,km\,s${}^{-1}$, and N$_{\rm{CO}}=1.2\times 10^{16}\>{\rm cm}^{-2}$. \cite{bernat_1979} noted that a simple assumption of the dust and gas being in thermal equilibrium would infer that the S1 and S2 components have a spatial extent of 4 and $55\arcsec$ respectively, using the dust model of \cite{tsuji_1979}. The S1 feature with its higher column density was well known from atomic absorption line studies \citep[e.g.][]{weymann_1962} and both features had been detected in high spectral resolution atomic Na and K absorption profiles \citep{goldberg_1975}.

\end{figure}

CO was first detected at radio wavelengths by \cite{knapp_1980} who presented a low S/N ratio spectrum of the $J= 2-1$ rotational emission line at 230\,GHz. They used a single dish antenna with a HPBW of $\sim 30\arcsec$ and detected one component expanding at 15\,km\,s$^{-1}$. They assumed this component to be the S2 component detected by  \cite{bernat_1979} and by assuming that they had resolved a flat top profile, predicted that its spatial extent didn't exceed $10\arcsec$. The weaker CO($J=1-0$) line was tentatively detected by \cite{knapp_1985} with a 7\,m dish which had a HPBW of 100$\arcsec$. \cite{huggins_1987} presented a higher signal-to-noise CO($J=2-1$) profile that was obtained with a HPBW of 32$\arcsec$ and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:5.2}. By comparing the  $(2-1)/(1-0)$ line intensities they found some evidence for an S2 radius of $\sim 16\arcsec$. However,  a 30\,m IRAM $J= 2-1$ line profile was later presented by \cite{huggins_1994} and as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5.2} looked remarkably similar, even though it was observed with a smaller 12$\arcsec$ HPBW. The profile did not show the horned wing signature expected if it had been resolved as discussed in Chapter 1, apparently in conflict with the previous S2 radius estimate. These single dish line profiles also showed no signature of the slower S1 shell and so questions remained about the spatial extent of these two distinct outflow components in the CSE of Betelgeuse. A sensitive high spatial resolution study of it's atmosphere was needed to untangle this puzzling evidence.

\section{Adopted Radial Velocity}\label{sec:5.2}

Before we discuss the CO($J=2-1$) spectra obtained from our multi-configuration CARMA observations which are summarized in Chapter 3, we begin by explaining which radial velocity value $v_{\rm{rad}}$, for Betelgeuse was adopted. An accurate value of $v_{\rm{rad}}$ is necessary when plotting the spectra of any star with respect to its center of mass rest frame, as we do for all spectra in this chapter. Plotting spectra in this frame of reference is intuitive as it allows the reader to immediately see the gas expansion velocity relative to the photosphere. A positive $v_{\rm{rad}}$ denotes recession (i.e., redshifted lines) while a negative $v_{\rm{rad}}$ denotes advancement (i.e., blueshifted lines).

Betelgeuse is a  semi-regular variable and its radial velocity exhibits variability on time scales ranging from short 1.5 year periods as suggested by \cite{stebbins_1931} to longer 5.8 year periods \citep{spencer_jones_1928,smith_1989}. 
\cite{stothers_1971} interpreted the long period as being the convective turnover time of giant convection cells on the stellar surface while \cite{dupree_1990} attribute the shorter period with pulsation. Betelgeuse's radial velocity amplitudes are also known to vary by at least $\pm 3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ \citep{smith_1989} making it difficult to determine a precise value for the stellar center of mass radial velocity. In Figure \ref{fig:5.3} we plot the radial velocity data and the corresponding model derived in the classical paper by \cite{sanford_1933} which is based on observations spanning 1923 to 1931. We have also extrapolated the model back to show that it matches the earlier data of \cite{bottlinger_1911} and \cite{spencer_jones_1928} quite well, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:5.3}. \cite{goldberg_1984} has also shown that the model of \cite{sanford_1933} can be extrapolated forward to give a reasonable fit to his measurements. In this study we adopt a heliocentric radial velocity of $+20.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$;  a value used by \cite{weymann_1962} and \citet{harper_2008} and is based on the mean values of \cite{spencer_jones_1928} and \cite{sanford_1933} radial velocity models.

In this study we use $+20.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ which is the mean value from the models of \cite{spencer_jones_1928} and \cite{sanford_1933}. The radial velocity amplitude variations of $\sim \pm 3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ is clearly evident in these data.}

\section{CARMA CO($J=2-1$) Spectra}
\label{sec:5.3}

The spectrum for each individual configuration image cube (which are composed of all the appropriate configuration tracks listed in Table \ref{tab:3.3}) along with the multi-configuration image cube (which is composed of the entire data set  spanning $\sim 2.5$\,yr) can be used to obtain information on the kinematics of the S1 and S2 flows. In particular, it is of interest to see how the CO($J=2-1$) line profile changes when observed  with different array configurations as each of these will be sensitive to emission on different spatial scales. . The spectra corresponding  to the C, D, and E configuration image cubes are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:5.4} for both the high ($0.65\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}\> \rm{bin}^{-1}$) and low ($1.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}\> \rm{bin}^{-1}$) spectral resolution data and were obtained by integrating all emission within a circular area of radius 5$\arcsec$ centered on the source. The high and low spectral resolution modes allow two independent sets of spectra to be measured for each observation and thus provide a good check on the data quality. The high resolution  spectra (channel width = $0.65\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) give the best measure of the S1 and S2 flow kinematics and therefore all outflow velocities are derived from these spectra.
%Prior to this study, the line had only ever been observed with single dish antennas and so the resolution was set by the HPBW of the antenna used, the maximum being the $12\arcsec$ HPBW beam of \cite{huggins_1994}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[trim=80pt 60pt 40pt 80pt, clip, width=9.0cm, height=12.0cm]{/home/eamon/thesis/thesis_template/5/f1.eps}
\caption{Spectra integrated over a radius of 5$\arcsec$ for each array configuration image cube. The blueshifted emission component between $-16.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-10.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ is almost resolved out in the C configuration image cube spectrum. The red and blue lines correspond to the high and low spectral resolution data respectively.}
\label{fig:5.4}
\end{figure}

The E configuration image cube spectrum has a total line width of $29.2\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and the low spectral resolution profile contains a steep blue wing emission feature between $-16.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-11\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and a more flat-topped feature between $-10.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-13.2\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$. This steep emission wing shows that the turbulence in the flow is less than or equal to the velocity bin size. The blue wing in the high resolution profile matches the lower resolution profile well but the remainder of the profile looks more complex than the flat-topped feature seen in the lower resolution profile. The line profile shape has been well documented by previous single dish observations (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:5.2}) and, out of our three individual configuration spectra, we expect the most compact E configuration spectra to resemble these single dish measurements the closest due to its better sampling of the inner $u-v$ plane and consequent sensitivity to extended structures. This indeed turns out to be the case when we compare our three individual configuration spectra to those previous single dish profiles. The blue wing emission feature appears again in the D configuration spectrum at the same velocities as those in the E configuration spectrum but the remainder of the profile appears quite different. Between $-10.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+13.2\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ the D configuration spectrum is dominated by a blue wing at $\sim$ $-10.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$, a red wing at $\sim$ $+13.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and an emission feature at $\sim$ $0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$. The large drop in emission at certain velocities in the D configuration spectrum is probably a result of the lower sensitivity to large scale structure in comparison to the E configuration as described in Table \ref{tab:3.2}.

The line profile has a lower flux ($\sim 50\,\%$) in the high spatial resolution C configuration spectrum due to its lack of sensitivity to extended structure. Notably, the blueshifted emission feature located between $-16.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-11.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ in the E and D configuration spectra is almost completely spatially filtered by the extended C configuration. This component of the line has previously been associated with the outer S2 flow \citep{huggins_1987} and as the majority of it has been spatially filtered by our C configuration we expect even less contribution from the S2 flow at lower absolute velocities still. For the redshifted line emission we again expect the majority of the S2 contribution to be spatially filtered, so we conclude that most, if not all of the emission in the C configuration spectrum emanates from the inner S1 flow. The spectrum is double peaked with the blue and redshifted wings extending to $-9.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+10.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ respectively, and we define these as the outflow velocities of S1. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:3} the C configuration has a resolving out scale of $\sim$ 6$\arcsec$ at 1.3 mm and so is not sensitive to angular scales larger than this. If the emission between $-9.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+10.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ in the C configuration spectrum appeared as a flat topped profile then we could conclude that the S1 flow lies within a radius of 3$\arcsec$ from the star. Clearly however, the profile has a more \textit{horned} shaped appearance and so the lower absolute velocity components of this profile have been spatially filtered. We can therefore conclude that the radial extent of the S1 from the star is greater than 3$\arcsec$. If we assume that the S1 flow would produce a 19.6 $\pm$ $0.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ wide top-hat line profile of 2 mJy were it not for the resolving out effects of the interferometer, its integrated line flux is then
\begin{equation}
F_{\rm{tot\,S1}}=F_{\nu}\times \left(\frac{\Delta v}{\lambda}\right)= 3.1 \times 10{}^{-19}\,\rm{W\,m}{}^{-2}.
\label{eq:5.1}
\end{equation}

To obtain the most robust value for the S2 outflow velocities we examine the high spectral resolution multi-configuration image cube spectrum which is composed of all tracks from all three configurations. It is worth stressing that by analyzing the multi-configuration image cube we make the assumption that the physical properties of all three components (i.e. $\alpha$ Ori, S1 and S2) have not changed over the total observation period (i.e. $\sim$ 2.5 yr). The profile is found to have a total linewidth of 28.6 $\pm$ $0.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$, which is in good agreement with previous single dish observations of the line where values of 30.6 $\pm$ $2.5\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $28.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ were reported by \cite{knapp_1980} and \cite{huggins_1987} respectively. The centroid velocity of the spectrum is  $-1.1 \pm 0.7$ km s$^{-1}$ ($\rm{v_{\rm{lsr}}}$ = 3.7 $\pm$ $0.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) which again is in good agreement with \cite{knapp_1980} and \cite{huggins_1987} values of $\rm{v_{lsr}}$ = 3.0 $\pm$ $2.5\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $\rm{v_{lsr}}$ = 3.7 $\pm$ $0.4\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$, respectively. We use Equation \ref{eq:5.1} to find the integrated total line flux to be 1.5 $\times 10^{-18}$\,W\,m$^{-2}$, of which at least 20\% emanates from the S1 flow.

\label{fig:5.5}
\end{figure}

The outflow velocities of S2 are $-15.4\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+13.2\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ which, like the S1 flow, are slightly asymmetric but in the opposite sense. Note that the S1 and S2 outflow velocities are dependent on the adopted radial velocity of Betelgeuse. If for instance, we instead adopt a radial velocity of 21.9 km s${}^{-1}$ \citep{famaey_2005} then the the S2 outflow velocities become even more asymmetric (-16.6 and $+12.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) while the S1 outflow becomes less so (-10.2 and $+9.4\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$). Both S1 and S2 therefore cannot have spherically symmetric outflow velocities regardless of the adopted stellar radial velocity. Adopting a mass of 18\,$M_{\odot}$ \citep{meynet_2003} and a radius of 950\,$R_{\odot}$ \citep{harper_2008} then the escape velocity for Betelgeuse is $85\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ which is much greater than the S1 and S2 outflow velocities. This indicates that the majority of the stellar mass loss mechanism's energy goes into lifting the CO molecules out of the gravitational potential and not into their outflow velocities. These outflow velocities are greater than the adiabatic hydrogen sound speed (i.e., $11.7\sqrt{10^{-4}T_{e}}$), which, if we assume that the gas temperature is the same as the excitation temperature, are $1.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $1\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ for S1 and S2 respectively. 

The spectra in Figure \ref{fig:5.5} are taken from the low resolution multi-configuration image cube using circular extraction areas ranging in radius from 1$\arcsec$ to 10$\arcsec$ and demonstrates how the line profile changes over these different extraction areas. The most striking change in the line profile is the change in appearance of the extreme blue wing. At small extraction radii where we sample the most compact emission, the feature is weak in comparison to the rest of the line but becomes more dominant as we begin to sample more of the extended emission. This indicates that even the high absolute velocity components of the S2 flow have extended emission and this is why they are almost completely spatially filtered by CARMA's C configuration. The large reduction of flux at $-11\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ suggests that there is more material moving towards the observer than at other lower absolute velocities indicating a non-isotropic (or non-spherical) S2 flow. This suggests a more sheet like (flatter) structure rather than a spherical cap.

Contour levels begin at $4\sigma$ where $1\sigma$ is the rms channel noise. The restoring beam is shown in green in the lower left corner of each map.}
\label{fig:5.6}
\end{figure}

We created three image cubes for each configuration by concatenating all good tracks together per configuration. The gradual formation of a ring type structure as one goes from high absolute velocities to lower absolute velocities indicative of a shell was not seen in any of these three image cubes. However, an additional spatially unresolved source was clearly detected in a number of the D configuration image cube maps (both high and low spectral resolution). The component is present in five continuous channel maps between $\sim$ $-4.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+2.4\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and is located $\sim$ 5$\arcsec$ S-W of $\alpha$ Ori. Its peak emission lies at $\sim$ $0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and has a flux density of 1.8\,mJy which is approximately 60$\%$ of the total source flux density at this velocity. The middle row in Figure \ref{fig:5.6} are two of these D configuration channel maps which clearly show this discrete source. The contour levels are set at the $4\sigma$ level so the detection of the second source in the D configuration is significant. The corresponding channel maps in the E configuration image cube show extended emission out to ~8$\arcsec$ in the same S-W direction as can be seen in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:5.6}. There is only weak emission detected in the same position in the corresponding C configuration channel maps, probably due to the lower sensitivity resulting from the smaller HPBW (i.e., the flux is diluted). This discrete second source thus has the effect of adding extra emission to the corresponding multi-configuration image cube spectrum at the low absolute velocities where it is present. The presence of this addition source at these low absolute velocities is probably one of the reasons why \cite{huggins_1994} did not detect a horned shaped spectrum with his 12$\arcsec$ HPBW. We also note that that there is a weaker emission feature 7$\arcsec$ north north-west of $\alpha$ Ori in these maps also which too can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5.6}. Finally, the Submillimeter Array CO($J=3-2$) line profile will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:5.10} but here we confirm that its image cube also contains this spatially unresolved source $\sim$ 5$\arcsec$ S-W of $\alpha$ Ori at the same velocities.

%\end{figure}

A subset of the blueshifted velocity channel maps of the low spectral resolution multi-configuration image cube is presented in Figure \ref{fig:5.7}. The first channel map at $-17.9\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ shows just the compact unresolved continuum emission with no extended emission present. Between $-16.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-9.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ we see evidence for the development of a classical shell signature for the S2 flow. We first sample the highest velocity components where the emission is relatively compact (i.e. between $-16.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-12.9\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) and then sample lower radial velocity components where S2 becomes a faint ring (i.e. between $-11.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-9.0\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$). At lower velocities again, these rings disappear into the noise of the maps and possibly extends out beyond the primary beam at zero velocity where S2 should have maximum spatial extent. The emission from the channel maps between $-15.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $-11.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ correspond to all the emission in the extreme blue wing component of the multi-configuration image cube line profile discussed in Section \ref{sec:5.3}. We can see in Figure \ref{fig:5.7} that all of this emission is greater than the C configuration resolving out scale of $\sim 6\arcsec$, therefore confirming that our C configuration line profile is mainly composed of S1 emission. The shell formation signature of S2 is also apparent in the redshifted velocity channel maps between $+7.5\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+13.8\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ but the emission appears weaker and the rings fainter therefore indicating that S2 is somewhat fragmented. The multi-configuration maps also show the central compact emission from the S1 flow at velocities between $-10.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $+11.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$. This S1 emission can be seen in the final two maps of Figure \ref{fig:5.7} as a central slightly elongated emission feature surrounded by the fainter rings of the S2 flow. The spatial extent of the S1 flow varies from channel map to channel map but appears to be larger than the 2$\arcsec$ value given by \cite{smith_2009}, who observed off-star wind scattered ro-vibration CO lines. 

\section{Spatial Extent of S2}\label{sec:5.6}
The spatial extent of the S2 flow around Betelgeuse was not directly determined from either the CO infrared absorption spectra of \cite{bernat_1979} or previous CO single dish radio observations \citep{knapp_1980, huggins_1987, huggins_1994}. Our low spectral resolution multi-configuration image cube has sufficient spatial resolution and S/N to make direct estimates of its maximum radius. We find that little or no signature of the S2 flow is present in the low absolute velocity channel maps where its spatial extent is maximum and either lies outside of the primary beam or is lost into the noise near the edge of the maps. Therefore we cannot make a simple direct measurement of its maximum size. However, by measuring how its size varies in the higher absolute velocity maps it is clearly present allows us to derive its maximum spatial extent. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption[Geometry of a spherical symmetric flow.]{Geometry of a spherical symmetric flow used to derive the spatial extent of the S2 flow. By measuring the spatial extent of S2 (i.e., $R_{\rm{S2}}\rm{sin}\theta$) as a function of channel/velocity (i.e., $V_{\rm{S2}}\rm{cos}\theta$) the maximum spatial extent of the S2 flow can be derived.}
\label{fig:5.8}
\end{figure}

If we assume that S2 is spherically symmetric with an outer radius $R_{\rm{S2}}$, and is undergoing steady expansion with velocity $V_{\rm{S2}}$, then its geometry is described by Figure \ref{fig:5.8}. As we sample the line at different velocities, the spatial extent of S2 changes and gets progressively larger at lower absolute velocities as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5.7}. We define the spatial extent of S2 in each map as
\begin{equation}
r_{\rm{chan}}=R_{S2}\times \rm{sin}\mathrm{\theta}
\label{eq:5.6a}
\end{equation}
which can be directly measured in many of the channel maps. Each of these channel maps have an associated velocity $V_{\rm{chan}}$, which we know, and is related to the actual velocity of the S2 flow by
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm{chan}}=V_{S2}\times \rm{cos}\mathrm{\theta}.
\label{eq:5.6b}
\end{equation}
Combining Equations \ref{eq:5.6a} and \ref{eq:5.6b} via the angle dependence, gives the following equation which contains $R_{\rm{S2}}$ as the only unknown parameter,
\begin{equation}
r_{\rm{chan}}= R_{\rm{S2}}\times \rm{sin}\left[\rm{cos}^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathit{V}_{chan}}{\mathit{V}_{S2}}\right) \right].
\label{eq:5.6c}
\end{equation}

The blueshifted model (left) corresponds to an outflow with a maximum radius of 17$\arcsec$ and a velocity of $16.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ while the redshifted model (right) corresponds to an outflow with a maximum radius of 16$\arcsec$ and a velocity of $13.8\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$. Note: The line profile is $1.9\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ wider in the low resolution image cube ($\Delta v$ = $1.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) than in the high resolution image cube.}
\label{fig:5.10}
\end{figure}

%We now use Equation \ref{eq:5.6c} to estimate the maximum projected spatial extent of S2 which occurs at zero velocity.
An estimate of the S2 radius per channel ($r_{\rm{chan}}$) was found by creating annuli of increasing radius around the central emission in each relevant line channel map of the multi-configuration image cube, extracting all flux within each annulus and then plotting these fluxes against distance from the star for each channel map as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:5.9}. The maximum of these resultant curves was then deemed to be the maximum radius of S2 per channel map. Figure \ref{fig:5.10} shows these data over-plotted with two model outflows which were created using Equation \ref{eq:5.6c}. The blueshifted data points were best fitted by a model outflow of maximum radius 17$\arcsec$ and outflow velocity $16.7\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$, while the redshifted data points were best fitted by a model outflow of maximum radius 16$\arcsec$ and outflow velocity $13.8\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$. It is worth mentioning that this estimate for the spatial extent of S2 is only weakly dependent on our adopted radial velocity value for Betelgeuse and adopting a slightly different value would simply alter the outflow velocities.

\section{Intensity distribution of CO}\label{sec:5.7}
We first investigate how one would expect the intensity of CO to vary as a function of distance from the star for a spherically symmetric optically thin outflow. The CO($J=2-1$) emission line is formed over an extended region around Betelgeuse so a constant outflow velocity can be assumed when investigating the intensity distribution of the S1 and S2 outflow. This allows us to use the equation of mass continuity to find the number density of the molecules in the lower level of the transition, $n_{l}$, i.e., $n_{l} \propto r^{-2}$. The Boltzmann formula can then be used to find the number density of CO molecules in the upper level, $n_{u}$, 
\begin{equation}
n_{u}(r)=n_{l}(r)\frac{g_{u}}{g_{l}}e^{-(E_u-E_l)/kT_{\rm{exc}}(r)}
\end{equation}
where $g_{u}$ and $g_{l}$ are the statistical weights of the two rotational levels, and $E_u$ and $E_{l}$ are their respective energies. Here, $T_{\rm{exc}}$ is the excitation temperature and equals to the gas temperature if collisions dominate the redistribution of the populations over the rotational ladder. To find the intensity we first need to know the emissivity, $j_{l}$, of the line photons which is just $n_{u}(r)$ times the probability for spontaneous de-excitation per second, $A_{ul}$, times the energy of the emitted photons, $h\nu$, i.e.,
\begin{align}
j_{l}(r)     & =  n_{u}(r)A_{ul}h\nu \nonumber \\
 &\propto r^{-2}e^{-(E_u-E_l)/kT_{\rm{exc}}(r)}.
\end{align}
If $T_{\rm{exc}}$ is constant then the line intensity, $I_{\rm{CO}}$, can be written as
\begin{align}
I_{\rm{CO}} & = \int j_{l}(r) dr  \nonumber \\
 &\propto r^{-1}.
\end{align}

In the left column of Figure \ref{fig:5.11} we investigate the intensity distribution of CO emission as a function of projected radius, $R$, for both the S1 and S2 flows. From our discussions in Section \ref{sec:5.3} we can assume that all line emission between -15.4 $\rightarrow$ $-10.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and +12.4 $\rightarrow$ $+13.8\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ emanates solely from the S2 flow. Using the low spectral resolution multi-configuration image cube we integrate the surface brightness over these channels and find that the intensity fall-off is close to being proportional to $R{}^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:5.11}: \textit{top left}). To investigate the S1 flow intensity distribution around $\alpha$ Ori we integrate the surface brightness over the channels between -9 $\rightarrow$ $+10.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$. Although these channels contain emission from both S1 and S2, most of the S2 emission here will have larger projected radii and thus the majority of the inner emission should emanate from the S1 flow.  Between 0.5$\arcsec$ and 4$\arcsec$ from the star the intensity is again found to be close to proportional to $R{}^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:5.11}: \textit{bottom left}). We have just showed that such an intensity distribution is expected for an optically thin homogeneous constant velocity outflow with $\rho \propto 1/\rm{R^{2}}$. Beyond $\sim 6\arcsec$ the intensity fall off is more rapid and is steeper than a $R{}^{-2}$ distribution and may be caused by factors such as a variation in the thermal or velocity profile, or even the absence of emitting material altogether. This region may mark the initiation of the current epoch of mass loss.

The emission has been extracted from the low spectral resolution multi-configuration image cube and is integrated over the channels where S1 is present (bottom) and over the channels where only S2 is present (top). Intensity proportional to $R{}^{-1}$ and $R{}^{-2}$ is also shown for comparison. \textit{Right Column:} The corresponding visibility amplitude as a function of $u-v$ distance ($q$) of both outflows can be modeled well by a $R{}^{-1}$ fall off in intensity.

\label{fig:5.11}
\end{figure}

Insight can also be gained into how the intensity varies on different size scales by conducting analysis in the $u-v$ plane and plotting the visibility amplitude of our CO data against $u-v$ distance. The result of this is shown in the right column of Figure \ref{fig:5.11} where the same channels corresponding to the S1 and S2 flows defined in the last paragraph have been used. The data are azimuthally averaged, and have been binned to produce one data point per k$\lambda$. The result for both the S1 and S2 data is a steep drop-off in visibility amplitude over a relatively short $u-v$ distance, signaling that the sources are well resolved, as expected. Both sets of visibility data agree with an intensity proportional to $(a^2 + R^2){}^{-1/2}$, where $a$ is an inner spatial limit. This is because the Hankel transform of this function is $q^{-1}e^{-2\pi aq}$ \citep{bracewell_2000}, where $q$ is the $u-v$ distance, and a vertically scaled version of this function is shown to match the visibility data very well in Figure \ref{fig:5.11}. As analysis in both the sky and $u-v$ plane indicate the intensity of both flows is proportional to $R{}^{-1}$ we conclude that when azimuthally averaged, both outflows are  consistent with an optically thin and quasi-steady flow which is in agreement with \cite{smith_2009} (i.e., S1) and \cite{plez_2002} (i.e., S2). 

\section{Spatial Extent of S1}\label{sec:5.8}
It is difficult to obtain an exact determination of the maximum spatial extent of the S1 flow  as we do not see the classical shell formation signature as we sample across velocities, like we do for the S2 flow. Its spatial extent varies in different channel maps and, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5.12a}, the emission is very inhomogeneous/clumpy. This clumpy nature of the S1 flow has been previously reported in other studies \citep{kervella_2011,smith_2009} and \cite{smith_2009}, who studied photospheric scattered emission, estimated its spatial extent to lie within $3\arcsec$ from the star. At 20\% of maximum emission in the integrated intensity S1 map (i.e. composed of all channels between -9 $\rightarrow$ $+10.6\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) the S1 flow extends out to a mean distance of $\sim$ 4$\arcsec$ and is even more extended in the S-W direction due to the presence of the second emission feature in the compact configuration data sets. Even though the emission is inhomogeneous, the intensity when averaged on the sky is consistent with a $\sim R^{-2}$ density distribution out to $\sim 6\arcsec$, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:5.7}, and may mark the end of the S1 flow. The HPBW of 0.9$\arcsec$ is not sufficient to determine whether the S1 flow is discrete or an extension of the current wind phase seen in ultraviolet spectra, e.g., \cite{carpenter_1997}, and cm-radio continuum interferometry \citep{lim_1998}.

\section{Continuum Flux Densities}\label{sec:5.9}
Betelgeuse is known to show brightness variations at many continuum wavelengths. \cite{goldberg_1984} reports a decrease of half a magnitude in visual brightness over a period of six years. \cite{bookbinder_1987} found stochastic 30\%-40\% variations in flux density at 6\,cm over timescales as short as 10 days to as long as 8 months (i.e. the observational period). A more comprehensive study was carried out by \cite{drake_1992} who observed Betelgeuse with the VLA at centimeter wavelengths from 1986 to 1990 and found stochastic variability of 22\%, 15\%, and 21\% at 6\,cm, 3.6\,cm, and 2\,cm respectively, at a variety of different timescales down to less than one month (a possible source for this variability will be described in Section \ref{sec:5.11}). The mm-continuum emission that we measure arises mainly from electron-ion and electron-atom bremsstrahlung (also the source of the longer wavelength continuum emission) and possibly dust emission, so it is not unreasonable to also expect variability at mm-wavelengths too.

In Table \ref{tab:5.1} we list the derived continuum flux densities for each of the three configuration image cubes and also the multi-configuration image cube. The high spectral resolution ($\Delta v$ = $0.65\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) image cubes were just wide enough to image the CO line but were too narrow to make accurate estimates of the continuum flux density. Therefore, all continuum flux density estimates are derived from the lower spectral resolution ($\Delta v$ = $1.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$) image cubes from which we were able to take accurate measurements at both sides of the line. We fitted elliptical Gaussians to $\sim$ 20 continuum channels using CASA's \textit{imfit} routine allowing the flux and corresponding uncertainties to be calculated. The source was unresolved in most of these continuum channels. The D configuration data were acquired under adverse weather conditions and these data have the highest noise levels out of the three configurations. Its continuum emission measurement is approximately 50\% greater than the C and E configuration continuum measurements which were also acquired approximately two years after the D configuration data.  We believe the continuum emission value of $289 \pm 21$\,mJy derived from the multi-configuration image cube is a reasonable estimation of the mean mm-continuum flux density over the two year period, 2007 $\rightarrow$ 2009. It is in reasonably good agreement with the 250\,GHz flux density of \cite{altenhoff_1994} who report a mean value of 351$\pm$25\,mJy for 1986 $\rightarrow$ 1989.

\section{Higher CO rotational lines}\label{sec:5.10}
As part of our larger multi-wavelength study of the CO surrounding Betelgeuse we were also able to obtain emission line profiles of higher rotational CO lines. First we observed the star (PI Harper: ID 81-0005-1) with the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies \cite[GREAT;][]{guesten_2000} instrument on NASA and DLR's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy \cite[SOFIA;][]{becklin_2009} 2.5\,m airborne observatory. Observations of the  CO($J = 12-11$; 1.382\,THz) line were made during Flight 86 on 2011 November 10 at 13,100\,m ($\sim$ 43,000 ft) when the star had an elevation of 45$^{\circ}$. The HPBW was $\sim 19\arcsec$ and the effective on source exposure time was 12 minutes which was considerably lower than the requested on source time of 70 minutes due to technical difficulties during the flight. We also obtained 4.1 hours on source at 345\,GHz with the Submillimeter Array \cite[SMA;][]{blundell_2007} on 2012 January 12 (PI J. Brown: ID 2011B-S051). The SMA is a submillmeter interferometer located  atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii and consists of eight antennas each 6\,m in diameter. Our data were acquired in the compact configuration ($B_{\rm{max}}=70$\,m) which at the observing frequency of $\sim 345$\,GHz gave a synthesized beam of $5\times 4.5$ arcsec$^2$ (similar to the CARMA E configuration at 230\,GHz). We obtained very high spectral resolution ($\Delta v= 0.088$\,km\,s$^{-1}$) of the CO($J = 3-2$; 345.796\,GHz) line which is more than a factor of 7 better than the highest spectral resolution CARMA CO($J = 2-1$) line, and also a weak detection of the SiO($J = 8-7$; 347.331\,GHz) line at a spectral resolution of 0.55\,km\,s$^{-1}$. Finally we obtained archival data of the CO($J = 6-5$; 691.473\,GHz), CO($J = 10-9$; 1.15198\,THz), and CO($J = 16-15$; 1.84135\,THz) rotational lines which were obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared \cite[HIFI;][]{deGraauw_2010}, on board the Herschel Space Observatory \citep{pilbratt_2010}. The HPBW for these lines were 31$\arcsec$, 18$\arcsec$, and 11.5$\arcsec$ respectively.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption[CO and SiO rotational emission lines from the CSE of Betelgeuse.]{CO and SiO rotational emission lines from the CSE of Betelgeuse. The lines are listed in order of increase excitation energy from bottom to top and are plotted in their stellar rest frame. The vertical dashed red lines mark the outflow velocities of the S1 flow. At higher excitation energies the relative strength of the blueshifted S2 feature in relation to the rest of the line decreases dramatically indicating that the higher excitation lines are formed mainly in the S1 flow.}
\label{fig:5.12}
\end{figure}

We plot all these line profiles in order of excitation energy in the stellar rest frame in Figure \ref{fig:5.12} to allow easy comparison. The profiles have been binned to $1.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ spectral resolution to match the CARMA low resolution profiles described in Section \ref{sec:5.3}, except for the SMA profiles which have exquisite resolution. In this figure the dashed vertical red lines mark the derived outflow velocities of the S1 flow from Section \ref{sec:5.3}. The figure demonstrates  that the CO rotational lines get narrower as one goes from lower rotational levels to higher ones i.e., as the excitation temperature increases. A noticeable consequence of this is the evolution of the contribution of the S2 blueshifted component which is the dominant feature in the CO($J=2-1$) combined configuration CARMA profile; its relative strength in relation to the rest of the line dramatically reduces at higher excitation temperatures. This indicates that the higher lines are predominately formed in the S1 flow region. The SOFIA CO($\textit{J} = 12-11$) profile is found to have a line width of $\sim \pm 7.5\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ when centered on the stellar rest frame but because the higher S/N ratio CO($J=16-15$) HIFI profile is slightly wider, the narrowness of the SOFIA line is probably due to its low S/N ratio. The weak SiO($J=8-7$) line profile is unfortunately contaminated with an atmospheric absorption feature but its linewidth is comparable to the CO($J=3-2$) line profile meaning that SiO is also present in the S2 flow. Previous searches for SiO in the CSE of Betelgeuse have been unsuccessful \cite[e.g.,][]{lambert_1978} and this may be the first, albeit weak, detection of the molecule. 

For the lower rotational line profiles it is difficult to infer the level of flux contribution from each of the S1 and S2 components making the analysis of integrated line flux ratios difficult. Also, some of these profiles shown in Figure \ref{fig:5.12} were obtained over many years with different instruments and techniques. It appears likely however, that the majority of the emission in the higher rotational profile [i.e., the CO($J=16-15$), CO($J=12-11$), and CO($J=10-9$) line profiles] emanates from the S1 flow, while the other lower level lines contain various amounts of emission from both flows. However, the CO($J=12-11$) line profile has a low S/N ratio and its flux scale is rather uncertain due to the poor pointing accuracy during our SOFIA-GREAT observation. For this reason only the Herschel/HIFI CO($J=16-15$) and the CO($J=10-9$) line profiles are suited for probing the thermodynamics of one of the flows, i.e., the S1 flow. The ratio of the integrated flux from these two rotational emission lines in a linear molecule like CO can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\frac{F_{10-9}}{F_{16-15}}=\left(\frac{J_{10-9}}{J_{16-15}} \right)^5 \mathrm{exp}\left(\frac{B[J_{16-15}(J_{16-15}+1)-J_{10-9}(J_{10-9} +1)]}{kT_{\rm{exc}}} \right)
\label{eq:5.9}
\end{equation}
where $F$, $J$, and $B$ are the integrated line flux, the rotational quantum number, and the rotational constant respectively. For the CO molecule $B/k = 2.77$. The integrated line fluxes for the CO($J=16-15$) and the CO($J=10-9$) profiles are $2.4\times 10^{-16}$  and $1.8\times 10^{-16}$\,W\,m$^2$ respectively. Equation \ref{eq:5.9} can then be used to show $T_{\rm{exc}} = 220$\,K which is in excellent agreement with \citeauthor{bernat_1979}'s \citeyear{bernat_1979} value of 200$^{+50}_{-10}$\,K for the S1 flow.

\section{CARMA CO observations in Context}\label{sec:5.11}
Previous single dish observations of the CO line with small HPBWs do not show the classical resolved signature of high emission at large absolute velocities and low emission at low absolute velocities for a number reasons. First, the S1 flow is still unresolved in these single dish observations and thus contributes emission and at the lower absolute velocities. As well as this, the multi-configuration CARMA maps show that the S2 emission is brighter in the higher absolute velocity maps than at lower absolute velocities and so when the emission from the fainter rings is neglected (i.e. when observed with a small HPBW), the overall line profile does not change significantly. Finally, our maps have revealed that some discrete strong emission features are present at low absolute velocities which would have been present in the HPBW of previous single dish observations, thus contributing the line profile flux at these velocities.

The main properties of the S1 and S2 flows which have been derived in the previous sections of this chapter are summarized in Table \ref{tab:5.2}. Assuming a mean outflow velocity of $14.3\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ and $9.8\>{\rm km\>s}^{-1}$ for the S2 and S1 flows respectively then their ages are $\sim 1100$ yr and $\sim 400 - 600$\,yr. Since \cite{plez_2002} have detected \ion{K}{i} out to $55\arcsec$ at a similar velocity to the CO S2 flow, then, assuming the CO and \ion{K}{i} are coupled, there appears to be little or no further acceleration in Betelgeuse's outflow once the S2 flow begins (which is somewhere greater than 6$\arcsec$).

Despite decades of research, it is also unknown if Betelgeuse's loses mass through episodic ejections or through more of a constant and global process. We have shown that when averaged across the sky, the variation in mean density is consistent with a spherically symmetric and constant velocity outflow. However, the presence of clumping is also evident in our radio maps and emission from the S2 flow appears weaker at redshifted stellar rest frame velocities indicating an inhomogeneous flow. Higher spatial resolution studies like those described in the following sections, are needed to determine if clumping is a result of growing instabilities in a global outflow or as a product of the mass loss mechanism. The reason for two unique velocities in the outflow are also a puzzle. One possibility is that the dust properties change at $\sim 6\arcsec$ and lead to a sudden increase in speed. However, the S2 component has a small velocity component along the line of sight \citep{bernat_1979} and appears as a shell like structure in our CARMA data so this scenario is unlikely. Another possibility is that the mass loss mechanism is magnetic in origin and that these components represent phases in the order of $\sim 600$\, yr of a stellar dynamo cycle. In this scenario, then one would expect more tenuous flows further out still. Such flows could be detectable with ALMA by mosaicing many images together to overcome the limited field of view of the antennas.

\section{e-Merlin 6\,cm Results}\label{sec:5.12}
The first detailed study of Betelgeuse at centimeter wavelengths was carried out by \cite{newell_1982}
who observed the star at multiple wavelengths (20, 6, 2, and 1.3\,cm) in a compact VLA configuration. The star was unresolved but a radio spectral index of 1.32 was derived and the radio emission was interpreted as emanating from a spherically symmetric, partially ionized chromosphere with an temperature of  $\sim 10,000$\,K extending from 1 to 4\,$R_{\star}$, in agreement with the Alfv\'en wave models of the time \citep{hartmann_1984}. The star was first spatially resolved at radio wavelengths by \cite{skinner_1997} with both the old VLA in its most extended configuration, and MERLIN (the predecessor to e-MERLIN). The data were taken $\sim 2.5$\,yr apart and it was found that the the 6\,cm radio emitting region was up to three time larger than the optical photosphere. The spatially resolved multi-wavelength study of \cite{lim_1998} revealed a cool, low hydrogen ionization inner atmosphere. To reconcile these observations with spatially resolved UV observations which showed a much warmer (i.e., chromospheric) inner atmosphere, \cite{lim_1998} concluded that there must be at least 3 orders of magnitude more cooler plasma than hot chromospheric plasma, because the radio opacity of the warm gas is much greater than that of the cooler gas. We now discuss the recent findings of \cite{richards_2013} who observed Betelgeuse at 6\,cm with the very long baseline interferometer, e-MERLIN.

e-MERLIN \citep{muxlow_2003} consists of seven radio antennas spread out across the United Kingdom that are connected via a fiber optic network to a central correlator at Jodrell Bank Observatory. It will eventually be able to observe in three frequency bands at $1.3-1.8$\,GHz, $4-8$\,GHz, $22-24$\,GHz, and its maximum baseline of 220\,km will provide resolution up to 10\,mas at the $\mu$Jy sensitivity level. Betelgeuse was observed at 5.76\,GHz (5.2\,cm) in 2012 July with e-MERLIN as part of Cycle-0 observations, with a total bandwidth of 0.512\,GHz. The final high resolution image which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:5.13} had a $\sigma _{\rm{rms}}=9\mu$\,Jy and was produced using uniform weighting using a restoring beam of ($80\times 60$) mas$^2$. The first thing to notice about the radio map is the presence of three clumps of radio emission in the south-west quadrant approximately 250\,mas (11.5\,$R_{\star}$) from the star, with detections ranging from 4 to $12\sigma _{\rm{rms}}$. These clumps of radio emitting plasma are probably the remnants of past localized episodic mass loss events from the star, which as they escaped the gravitational potential of the star, expanded, cooled allowing hydrogen to recombine and thus in the process becoming fainter radio continuum emitters than they initially were. Assuming a mean constant flow velocity of 5\,km\,s$^{-1}$ \citep[see Figure 10 in][]{harper_2001}, then this plasma was ejected from the star $\sim 45$\, yr prior to these observations but could be almost double this value if the slow wind acceleration profile given in \cite{harper_2001} is assumed.

The second and more remarkable feature of the image is that the star at 6\,cm appears as two unresolved peaks separated by $\sim 90$\,mas. To make sure this unexpected result was not an artifact of the imaging process we plotted the visibility amplitude as a function of baseline (i.e., $\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$) as shown also in Figure \ref{fig:5.13}. If we had resolved a standard uniform disk, which should be a good first order approximation for any \textit{standard} star, then we would expect the visibility amplitude to drop to zero at some stage, which clearly does not happen. On the other hand, the visibility amplitude for a double source would depict two peaks with the minimum visibility amplitude being a function of the component brightness ratio. For equal brightness (i.e., the ratio is 1) the first visibility amplitude minimum drops to zero but does not for sources of different brightness \citep{saha_2011}. Therefore, the visibility amplitudes of our our calibrated data appear to be in agreement with what is seen in the final image, i.e., two sources of different brightness producing a sinusoidal visibility pattern which does not drop to zero.

The black contours represent the high spatial resolution 6\,cm image of the star from \cite{richards_2013} and are at the $4\sigma _{\rm{rms}}$ level. This solution puts the optical photospheric position almost at the position of the weaker unresolved peak.}

The brighter feature was found to have a brightness temperature of $T_{\rm{b}}=5,400\pm 600$\,K while the weaker feature had $T_{\rm{b}}=3,800\pm 500$\,K. To find the position of the optical photosphere, \cite{richards_2013} took the peak flux position from a low resolution radio map which was optimized for sensitivity to extended structure. In this scenario the two features, referred to as \textit{hotspots} by \cite{richards_2013} are located 1.0 ($T_{\rm{b}}=5,400$\,K) and 1.5\,$R_{\star}$ ($T_{\rm{b}}=3,800$\,K) from the optical photosphere. A more rigorous approach to finding the position of the optical photosphere is to use the astrometric solutions derived in a study to find the distance to Betelgeuse \citep[solution 5 in][]{harper_2008} and propagate these forward to find its expected position in 2012 July. Doing this we get RA\,$=05:55:10.3250$ and dec\,$=+07:24:25.536$ which includes the correction for parallax. We plot this expected position on top of the e-MERLIN map in Figure \ref{fig:5.14}. Interestingly, this puts the expected optical photospheric position almost directly on top of the weaker emission feature. The effective temperature of Betelgeuse is 3,650\,K \citep{levesque_2005} which is slightly below the brightness temperature derived for this feature but well within its errors (i.e., $T_{\rm{b}}=3,800\pm 500$\,K). If this weaker source is indeed the optical photosphere, then the brighter source with $T_{\rm{b}}=5,400\pm 600$\,K is located at least $3.5\,R_{\star}$ from the surface of the optical photosphere. Its value is significantly higher than that predicted in the spherically symmetric semi-empirical model of \cite{harper_2001} who predict a value of 2,300\,K at a projected radius of 95\,mas (i.e., $3.5\,R_{\star}$ from the photosphere).

\label{fig:5.15}
\end{figure}

The semi-empirical model of \cite{harper_2001} is the current \textit{state of the art} inner (i.e., $1 \rightarrow 10\,R_{\star}$) atmospheric model for Betelgeuse. It consists of a detailed mean density and temperature one-dimensional model and is based on the spatially resolved VLA data of \cite{lim_1998}. In this model the temperature distribution peaks at 1.45\,$R_{\star}$ where it reaches $\sim 3800$\,K and decreases to $\sim 3800$\,K at 10\,$R_{\star}$. The dominant source of electrons is from photoionized metals while hydrogen has a low level of ionization. 
We use this model to create a two-dimensional spherically symmetric specific intensity map to examine how it compares with the new e-MERLIN high resolution data at 5.2\,cm (5.75\,GHz). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:5.15}, we convolved this map with a restoring beam, first with dimensions ($180\times 180$) mas$^2$ to match the low resolution e-MERLIN image and then with dimensions ($80\times 60$) mas$^2$ to match the high resolution e-MERLIN image. As can be seen from Figure  \ref{fig:5.15}, the atmospheric model of \cite{harper_2001} does a good job in reproducing the low resolution e-MERLIN image but, as would be expected from a spherically symmetric 1-D model, fails to reproduce the more complex structure which is seen in the higher resolution e-MERLIN image. The advent of the new e-MERLIN interferometer with its superior spatial resolution to that of the VLA has revealed that 1-D spherically symmetric atmospheric models are probably hopelessly inadequate in describing the inner atmospheric conditions of Betelgeuse. Time dependent models which radically diverge from spherical symmetry will ultimately be needed to accurately describe the inner atmospheric conditions of Betelgeuse.

\section{Multi-wavelength VLA-Pie Town Results}\label{sec:5.13}
At the end of Chapter \ref{chap:3} we describe the VLA-Pie Town observations of Betelgeuse from the early 2000's along with the motivation for analyzing it. In summary, we wanted to see if there was some signature of the e-MERLIN asymmetries in the data set, because the Pie-Town link when connected to the VLA provided resolution comparable to or exceeding that of the e-MERLIN data set at the shortest wavelengths.

Should be roughly 50 mas from optical photosphere. No assymetries present. Therefore ballistic ejection or looking into deeper cooler layers?? too many uncertainties with the time difference between them too long
