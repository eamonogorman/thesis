\chapter{Discrete Absorption Feature}\label{app:2}

During this study we analyzed \textit{HST} STIS spectra of Arcturus from the online StarCAT catalog \citep{ayres_2010}. The \ion{Mg}{ii} h and k lines from data obtained in 2001 show a wind velocity $ \thicksim 30-40 \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}}$, which is similar to that adopted in the Drake models for this star \cite{drake_1985}. A narrow discrete absorption feature was found at $-49 \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}}$ in the broad blue-shifted wind absorption component of both lines as shown in Figure \ref{fig:app2}. For this discrete feature we find a most probable turbulent velocity of $ 3.4 \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}}$ and a Mg column density\footnote{Assuming all Mg to be Mg II} of $1.4\times10^{12}$\, cm$^{-2}$. A Mg column density of $10^{15}$\, cm$^{-2}$ is required to produce the blueward absorption components in the \textit{h} and \textit{k} lines \citep{mcclintock_1978}. Therefore, this discrete absorption feature accounts for $\thicksim 0.1 \%$ of the total wind column density.

A function composed of a linear combination of a Gaussian and a quadratic fitted the discrete absorption feature the best. The red data in the upper row shows the data that is used in this analysis.}
